# Marketplace Integration Status

## Current Status: Manual Installation Only ✅

This repository uses **manual installation** exclusively. This is the recommended and proven method.

### Why Manual Installation?

1. **✅ Proven to work** - Already tested and functioning
2. **✅ Simple** - Just clone and copy
3. **✅ Fast** - Takes ~30 seconds
4. **✅ No dependencies** - Just needs git
5. **✅ Team-friendly** - Easy to document and share
6. **✅ Reliable** - No schema compatibility issues

### Marketplace Plugin Support

After extensive testing, Claude Code's marketplace.json schema is:
- Not publicly documented
- Appears to be in early development or experimental
- Multiple schema formats tested without success
- **Conclusion:** Stick with manual installation for now

### Installation Methods

|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Manual Clone & Copy** | ✅ Works perfectly | ✅ **Yes** |
| **Git Submodule** | ✅ Works | For advanced users |
| **Symlinks** | ✅ Works (Unix/Mac) | For development |
| **Marketplace Plugin** | ⚠️ Schema unclear | Not currently |

### Future Marketplace Support
