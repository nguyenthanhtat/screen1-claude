# 3. Keep shortcuts short and memorable
# 4. Prefix with 'g' to avoid conflicts (gcommit, gbranch, etc.)
# 5. Test shortcuts: try them in Claude Code CLI

# Example usage after configuration:
#   /gcommit          → Routes to /git/basics commit workflow
#   /gbranch          → Routes to /git/branching operations
#   /gundo            → Routes to /git/undo for recovery
#   /gconflict        → Routes to /git/conflicts for resolution

# Note: Shortcuts are optional. You can always use:
#   /git [question]                  → Auto-routing
#   /git/basics                      → Direct sub-skill access
#   /git/basics help me commit       → Sub-skill with question
